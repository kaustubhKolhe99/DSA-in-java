# DSA_in_java üìö

## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Welcome to my DSA_in_java repository! This is where I explore Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using the Java programming language. Currently, I am on a journey of learning and diving deeper into the fundamentals of DSA with Java. 

Feel free to explore the code in this repository. While it's primarily a learning space for me, you're welcome to use the code for your own learning purposes, experimentation, or any other non-commercial use.

## What's Inside? üìÅ

In this repository, you'll find various Java programs and implementations related to different data structures and algorithms. Here's a brief overview of what you can expect to find:

- **Data Structures:** Implementations of common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms:** Implementations of algorithms for sorting, searching, traversals, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, etc.
- **Example Applications:** Practical examples and applications of data structures and algorithms in real-world scenarios.

## How to Use? üõ†Ô∏è

Feel free to clone or download this repository to your local machine and explore the code. You can run the Java programs directly in your preferred IDE or compile and execute them using the Java compiler.

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your_username/DSA_in_java.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd DSA_in_java

# Compile and run a Java program
